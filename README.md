# NYC-Property-Sales

## About The Project
This project focused on monthly sales of apartment units which exhibit fluctuating trends on the [NYC Property Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/new-york-city/nyc-property-sales) dataset. We've extracted and cleaned the data specifically for apartments (walkup & elevator), excluding any other property types that might be present in the original data. By concentrating on just the apartment units, this project aims to gain deeper insights specifically into the apartment market trends.
